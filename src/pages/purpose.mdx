# the purpose.

Artistic or creative projects make you feel something, as the act of creating helps students deepen an emotional connection to the course material. Interacting with and creating within the realm of monsterology must also deepen that emotional connection to the material. It is then in the act of unpacking that connection, that interaction, that creation where the artist statement synthesizes the students learning.

Artist statements ask students to justify the decisions they’ve made, and how their creative product reflects course content. This is important for understanding students' thinking and their process of making and designing. It makes their implicit or potentially hidden ideas within the work explicit.  It is also an important part of the learning process for the student, as it involves quite a bit of metacognitive reflection. They’ve not only thought about how to translate content into artistic medium, but thought again about how successfully they’ve done it, and how easy/difficult it was.

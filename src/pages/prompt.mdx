## Writing an Artist’s Statement
An artist statement is meant to supplement your monstrously artistic creation and invite the audience into a deeper dialogue with your piece and your creative process. It can take things that are implicit in your artwork and render them explicit. It’s your chance to explain or expand upon concepts or questions you were exploring through your artwork that connect to the course material. So in 1-2 pages, offer us an explanation of and rationale for the piece.

These statements could involve accounts of your process; they could gesture towards significant details and elements that we might overlook; they could put your work in the broader context of ideas and historical narratives you’ve encountered in the course. There are many routes you can take, but your statement should somehow supplement your artistic creation in a way that lets us appreciate the significance of your work, and, in particular, the connection between your work and the ideas you’ve encountered in our course.

### Here are some questions you might consider as you write your statement:

#### Your purpose in creating the piece:
* How can you make ideas that are implicit or hidden in your piece explicit? What is the piece meant to communicate to your audience (including the audience that will be assigning you your grades!)?
* How has creating this piece helped you process the course material? Explain what makes the work significant and academically rigorous.
* What are some of the big guiding concepts that shape your purpose for this piece?
ie. If you wanted to create something beautiful, explore how your notion of beauty has been shaped by your lived experience and your learning in the course.
* List any inspirations/influences for this piece. Are you responding to another’s work? Are you borrowing or remixing another work? How does your own life’s experiences inform the work?

#### Your process in creating the piece:
* What materials, tools, and techniques did you use in creating this piece? Why did you choose those materials, tools, and techniques? What effect do they each have on the piece as a whole?
* Describe your process in creating this piece.
* What was the timespan of your process? How did that affect your work?
* What was/were the setting(s) of your process? How did that affect your work?
* Were other artists involved in the process? How did you collaborate?
* What were some moments of frustration in your process?
* What were some moments of surprise in your process?

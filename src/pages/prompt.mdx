# the prompt.

An artist statement is meant to supplement your artistic creation and invite the audience into a deeper dialogue with your piece and your creative process. This is your chance to explain or expand upon concepts or questions you were exploring through your artwork that connect to the course material. Tell your story and the story of the piece! Artist statements are usually no longer than a page, but as the artist you ultimately have the agency to decide what parameters to set for yourself. Below you will find some questions that most artist statements answer. They are meant to generate ideas and responses. Again, you are the artist–-so focus on the questions that will best guide your communication of the work! That being said, please note the importance of using this statement to synthesize your creative project with the course material.
